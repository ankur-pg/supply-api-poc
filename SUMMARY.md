# Project Cleanup Summary

## What we've accomplished

1. **Simplified and Organized Code Structure**
   - Removed redundant and duplicated code
   - Created a modular architecture with clear responsibilities
   - Added proper TypeScript types and interfaces

2. **Improved Data Management**
   - Streamlined the data import process
   - Created reusable utilities for Elasticsearch operations
   - Maintained only essential sample data

3. **Enhanced API Design**
   - Ensured both REST and GraphQL APIs work correctly
   - Fixed compatibility issues between Elasticsearch client and NestJS
   - Improved error handling and response formatting

4. **Better Documentation**
   - Created ARCHITECTURE.md with system overview
   - Updated README with clear instructions
   - Added inline code documentation

## Project Structure

The project now has a clean structure with:
- Essential sample data in `assets/`
- Reusable Elasticsearch utilities in `utils/`
- A single data import script in `scripts/`
- Properly working REST controllers and GraphQL resolvers

## API Access

The API provides multiple ways to access the data:

### REST API
- `GET /listings` - Get all property listings
- `GET /listings/:country` - Get listings filtered by country

### GraphQL API
- `POST /graphql` with GraphQL queries
- Example query:
  ```graphql
  {
    supplyStats(input: {country: "SG"}) {
      totalListings
      minPrice
      maxPrice
      avgPrice
    }
  }
  ```

## Next Steps

Potential improvements for future development:
1. Add authentication and authorization
2. Implement pagination for large result sets
3. Add more advanced filtering options
4. Create automated tests for the API endpoints
5. Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment
